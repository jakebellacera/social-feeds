# Social Feeds plugin for WordPress

Social Feeds is a social feed manager for wordpress. You can create feeds using many social network providers and then display them through a shortcode or as a widget. Social Feeds is designed to be fast and will cache all feeds in the database for a certain amount of time. This will cut down on load times and cut down on requests to prevent your application from becoming rate-limited.
